1)What  is HFile?
A) *Hfiles are File format for hbase. 
*It is very fast.
*file of sorted key/value pairs. 
*Both keys and values are byte arrays.


2)What is HRegion Server?
A)
*HRegionServer makes a set of HRegions available to clients.  
There are many HRegionServers in a single HBase deployment.
*Region servers serve data for reads and writes.
*Regions are assigned to the Region Servers.

3)What is HBase Meta Table?
A)
When a table is in the process of splitting two other columns will be created, info:splitA and info:splitB 
which represent the two daughter regions. The values for these columns are also serialized HRegionInfo instances.
 After the region has been split eventually this row will be deleted.

4)What  is zookeeper?
A)
HBase uses ZooKeeper as a distributed coordination service to maintain server state in the cluster.
Zookeeper maintains which servers are alive and available, and provides server failure notification.

5 How read and write operation is performed in HBase.
A)
*Read Operation:
A read request is sent to zookeeper from Hbase by the client.
The zookeeper,gives the address for the META table.
The data is written in BlockCache, so that the next time, it can be instantly accessed by the client 
Finally the read process with required data will be returned to client along with acknowledgment.

*Write Operation:
When the client issues a Put request, the first step is to write the data to the write-ahead log, the WAL:
Edits are appended to the end of the WAL file that is stored on disk.
Once the data is written to the WAL, it is placed in the MemStore.
